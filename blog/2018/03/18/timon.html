    <div class="posttitle">Tim칩n</div>
    
    <p/> I was just thinking about how I could adapt "tim칩n" to other languages.
    I could not just translate as some nautical or aviation term.

    <p/> The artistic (if I can say that) vision I have is not so clear.
    Would it be a huge motivation for life?
    
    <p/> Now I find myself searching for a tim칩n.

    <p/> I just can not keep writing and writing in a consistent line. I am not used to talk about this personal subjects.

    <p/> While I write this post, I decided I will write more about tech things. Although I am exercising interpersonal relations and to write about my feelings is somehow related, I think it is better to talk about things if I can write longer sentences about these things (or if my thoughts is clearer).
